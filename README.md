# IOU
Have you ever been in a situation where friends or roommates keep forgetting to pay their share on time? Sending constant reminders to them about what they owe can get awkward. IOU is an app that allows people that owe each other money to easily keep track of the payments that they need to make.

# MVP
1. User account registration and authentication
2. User profiles with 
    - Friends list
    - Payments the user needs to make 
    - Payments that are owed to the user 
    - Achievements
3. Bill splitting functionality
    - Users can select people from their friends list that they want to split a certain amount with
    - The app will calculate the appropriate amount and update each person’s profile
4. Search and add friends functionality
5. Reminders and notifications about payments that need to be made
6. Achievements that can be unlocked upon splitting their first bill, with streaks of paying on time, etc. 
7. Leaderboard based on the user’s friends. (The person with the most achievements will be highest in the leaderboard. This logic is flexible, the team can decide to change it).

# Stretch Goals
1. Functionality to split bills with people that don’t have the app
2. Adding an option to categorize bills
3. Spending analysis based on categories of bills
4. In app payment option through third-party
